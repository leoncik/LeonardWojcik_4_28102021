## Test the JavaScript form validation

In order to check if the JavaScript used for checking the form is valid, add the "novalidate" attribute in the form tag, like this :

```html
<form id="contact-form" name="reserve" action="index.html" method="get" novalidate>
```

(don't forget to delete this attribute after your tests in order to enable the double verification !)
